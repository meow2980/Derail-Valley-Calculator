This is a java program I made. This program calculates many aspects of the train for you so you don't have to worry about it, and does it quickly.

It allows for efficent calculations of information like weight, tonnage, length, and more in a quick way when you have multiple jobs.

When you have multiple jobs and deliver one you can type "next" you can instantly get the new calculations.

.

I show how to download and use the program in a video with the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP6yvLd1Ui8  

This is a video on the longer side and I wouldn't recomend watching all of it. If you need help watch specific parts, the start shows to to install and use it, then I show examples.

By running the code and typing in "help" it does also say how you use it.

.

I used the java IDE named bluej to build and test it, I would recommend using it if you decide to use this program.

(currently I have included a bluej package file, if your not using bluej you should remove it. Otherwise I would recomend using it as I belive it will keep the classes organised, though if there are problems compiling the code try putting in your own)

.

If you notice and bugs or things to you want me to improve on the program, let me know and ill update the program when I have time. If you notice a program breaking bug, let me know ASAP and I will fix the program ASAP.

(There are a few ways to do this, on the video I posted, my discord with the link https://discord.gg/wUWdn3B   or I also believe you can do it in github)

.

-Useful tip, Type the code in the steam overlay notes tab, then copy it over (as shown in video)

-order of inputs doesn't matter for the code, most code can be put in the same line

-destination and code sequences are the only time order matter

-words will automaticaly become apart of the destination, if this was a mistake you can enter "reset destination" to reset the destination (destination track remains set) (forgot to mention this in video)

-All possible operations can be found in the help menu
